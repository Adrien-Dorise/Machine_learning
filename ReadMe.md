These programs are used to help implement machine learning solutions for anomaly detection.
Here are the features:
	- Import data from txt to Python
	- Plot data that take form of time series
	- Perform feature extraction using statistical and/or frequency analysis 
	- Training of supervised anomaly detection methods (classification)
	- Plot of classification boundaries (K-nn, naive Bayes, decision tree, random forest, SVM, restricted Boltzmann machines,)
	- Training of clustering methods (K-Means, hierarchical clustering, DBSCAN, DyClee)
	- Plot of clustering boundaries
	- Train of one-class classification methods (Elliptic enveloppe, isolation forest, local outlier factor, one-class SVM, auto-encoders)
	- Display of results (confusion matrix + execution time)
	
In addition, some neural networks tools are available:
	- regression with recurrent neural networks
